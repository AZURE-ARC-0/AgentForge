## Module Agents

Our in house modules come with their own agents. These agents, built using the AgentForge framework, serve as exemplars of the system's capabilities. By examining these agents, you can glean insights into how they harness the power of method overriding to fine-tune their behaviors for specific tasks.

### Action Execution Module Agents

The **[Action Execution Module](../ActionExecution.md)** in the AgentForge framework is a key component that orchestrates the execution of actions. Actions, composed of one or more tools, represent complex tasks or workflows.

- **[Action Priming Agent](ActionPrimingAgent.md)**: Take a look at how this agent primes actions, setting the stage for more complex tasks.

- **[Action Selection Agent](ActionSelectionAgent.md)**: Dive into the decision-making process with an agent that excels in selecting the most apt action from a given set.

### **More Module Agents Will Be Documented Soon**

These module agents not only offer a practical starting point but also inspire creativity. Analyze their inner workings, adapt their strategies, and build upon them to create your unique modules.
